            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Board Game Café. Thats us! Were not just a board game café in Stockholm, we are a bunch of people who love games, love good food & drinks and love to have great time together. We are located in the heart of Stockholm, Östermalm. Our mission is to bring people and reconnect back together! 

                We at Board Game Café have more than 1,000 games in our massive game library. The concept is you can grab any game you like or have one of the Team Gurus recommend one for you and your team. In either case, we bring out the game, set It up for you, explain all the rules and even play a quick round with you to make sure you are playing the game correctly. 
                
                You can sit and play as many games as you like for as long as you like, we only charge 99 SEK per person.

        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>Even though you might think that Board Games Café is new concept, our story began in the early 2000s, we started first in London and expanded now to majority of the big European cities. Board Game Café team started with two young entrepreneurs, both driven by love for delicious food, tasty drinks, board games, social connections and happy times. 
            We believe strongly in our values: Friendliness – coziness – togetherness!

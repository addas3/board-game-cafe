                <h2>Board Games</h2>
            <p>We have more than 1,000 Board games in our massive library wall. Choose a game or have one of our Game Gurus recommend you one for you and your Group. Whether you choose a Board Game or we recommend one, in either case we will bring the game out, set it up and explain all the rules, from A to Z. We make sure you are playing the game the right way. If you and your group wish we can even play a quick round with one of our Game Gurus. 
                There are no rules, you can play as many games as you like and for as long as you for 99 SEK per person.
